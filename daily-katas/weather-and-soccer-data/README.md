## Part One: Weather Data

http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_four_data_.html

In weather.dat you’ll find daily weather data for Morristown, NJ for
June 2002. Download this text file, then write a program to output the
day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the
maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third
column).

## Part Two: Soccer League Table

The file football.dat contains the results from the English Premier
League for 2001/2. The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total
number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so
Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals scored
against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the
smallest difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.

## Part Three: DRY Fusion

Take the two programs written previously and factor out as much common
code as possible, leaving you with two smaller programs and some kind
of shared functionality.

## Kata Questions

1. To what extent did the design decisions you made when writing the
   original programs make it easier or harder to factor out common
   code?
2. Was the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the
   first?
3. Is factoring out as much common code as possible always a good
   thing? Did the readability of the programs suffer because of this
   requirement? How about the maintainability?
